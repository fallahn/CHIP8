CHIP8 - A CHIP-8 interpreter written in C++
-------------------------------------------

A small project implementing a [CHIP-8 interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) using SFML for windowing and
input. This is purely a learning exercise as a precursor to (hopefully) learning something about emulation of 8-bit 
systems. It is free and open source in the hopes that it may be of use to others as an educational resource, but no
warranty is claimed as to the correctness or completelness of this software. CHIP8 should build on any platform which 
supports SFML using either the included VS2015 project for Windows or the CMake file to generate project files (mostly
for linux users).
